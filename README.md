# Calculator
A basic x86-64 assembly calculator for Linux

Tested on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS; probably works for most versions of Linux. Created as the course project for SRJC's CS 12 (Assembly) class in the Spring 2021 term.

To compile, simply `make main` and then run from terminal with `./main`. The Makefile is set up for yasm and ld.
